        <div class="section" id="introduction">
            <p>This interactive guide will provide you with a basic understanding of jQuery and how to use it on your own projects. You'll learn how to install jQuery, how to select and modify elements and we'll even show you how to do a really cool jQuery animations.</p>

            <p>This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and CSS selectors. If you need a refresher on these topics you can use <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/terminology-syntax-intro" target="blank">Shay's intro to CSS & HTML</a>.</p>

            <p>Note: In order to make this guide a bit more fun we're using Ryu, from Street Fighter, and his world famous Hadoukens. As you can imagine, both Ryu and his Hadoukens are trademarks of <a href="http://www.capcom.com/" target="blank">Capcom</a>. Also, we're not going to cover jQuery best practices or provide you with the fastest way to achieve something. Instead, we're going to take the time to explain how things work by using step-by-step examples.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Ready? Let's dive in!</h2>
        <div class="section" id="what-is-jquery">
            <h3>What is jQuery</h3>
            <p>A said on jQuery.com: "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling..."</p>

            <p>Here's another way to put it: jQuery is a very powerful JavaScript library that helps you do awesome things within the browser without having to worry about cross-browser differences. This means that the jQuery code you write will work seamlessly in Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="installing-jquery">
            <h3>How to install jQuery?</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to install jQuery is to grab the code from <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery" target="blank">Google</a>. Here is the code snippet:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>Note: Notice that there's no "http:" or "https:" before the "//" in the src of the tag. This ensures that both HTTP and HTTPS pages can load this code. If you're coding locally on your computer you'll need to add "http:" to the beginning of the src to make sure jQuery loads. Here's what your script should look like:</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

            <p>You can now create a basic html file and add the jQuery script inside the &lt;head&gt; tag. In the example below we also added a JavaScript file called 'example.js', this is where we would hypothetically write our jQuery code.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="example.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- Your content goes here -->
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Note: You'll want to make sure to only use jQuery once your DOM is ready. Don't worry if this sounds abstract and confusing, <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/" target="blank">here's an explanation and how to achieve this</a>.</p>

            <p>For the rest of this guide we'll be using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="blank">Google Chrome's</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console" target="blank">console</a>. While you can use any browser you like, we recommend you switch to Chrome and follow along.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Time to get our hands dirty!</h2>
        <div class="section" id="opening-the-console">
            <h3>Opening Chrome's console</h3>
            <p>Google Chrome gives you access to this thing called the "console". The console allows you to write JavaScript (and, in our case, jQuery) code and see the results right away. Here's how to open the console:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the keyboard shortcut Command - Option - J (Mac) or Control -Shift -J (Windows/Linux).</li>
                <li>Select View > Developer > JavaScript Console.</li>
            </ul>
            <image src="images/chrome-console-1.png" class="screenshot" />
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="selecting-an-element">
            <h3>Selecting an element with jQuery</h3>
            <p>To select the green box below, simply type this in your console then press "enter":</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box')</code></pre>

            <div id="green-box" class="fixed"></div>
            
            <p>You should see something like this</p>
            <image src="images/green-box-1.png" class="screenshot" />

        </div>
        <div class="section" id="jquery-api">
            <h3>Using the jQuery API for Fun</h3>
            <p>Now that you know how to select an element, let's go ahead and change the color of our square. How about a nice <a href="http://www.crockford.com/wrrrld/color.html" target="blank">LightSkyBlue</a> color (that's the name of the CSS color)? In order to do this we will use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/css/" target="blank">jQuery's CSS API</a>.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('background-color','lightskyblue')</code></pre>
            <p class="protip">Protip: You can use the "up" arrow in your console to get the last command you typed. This will save you tons of time.</p>
            <p class="protip">Protip numero-dos: Even though you can copy/ paste the sample code provided, I strongly suggest you actually type things out. This will help you learn wayyy more. Promise!</p>

            <p>Let's now change the border color to a nice <a href="http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/images/1/15/Zoolander.jpg" target="blank">steelblue</a> color. Any guess as to how to do this?</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('border-color','steelblue')</code></pre>

            <p>Actually, how about we remove the background color? We can do this by setting the background color to 'transparent'.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('background-color','transparent')</code></pre>

            <p>Ready for something amazing? Let's add a hadouken inside our box to see what happens. Good thing we have a nice little hadouken saved up at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif</a>. In order to add this to our box we will use jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/html/" target="blank">HTML</a> api which allows us to add HTML to any given element and we'll add an <a href="http://htmldog.com/reference/htmltags/img/" target="blank">HTML image</a>.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').html('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" />')</code></pre>

            <p>Another way to add the hadouken would be to use jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/append/" target="blank">Append</a> API.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" />')</code></pre>

            <p>Extra credit: Can you guess what happens if you run the 'append' command several times? Now try running the 'html' one several times. I'll let you play with this for a minute....</p>

            <p>Were you able to spot the difference? If you were to say that the 'append' command keeps on appending hadoukens forever while the 'html' command replaces everything with only 1 hadouken you'd be 100% right!</p>

            <p class="protip">Protip: Remember that you can use the "up" arrow in your console to go back to a previous command.</p>

        <div class="section" id="end-goal">
            <h2>Our Small jQuery Project</h2>
            <p>By now you should have a basic understanding on how to use jQuery. In order to gain more experience using this amazing library we're going to work on a small project together.... are you ready? We're going to have <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ryu+hadouken&tbm=isch" target="blank">Ryu fire a hadouken</a>. Here's what our end project will look like. (Make sure to hover on Ryu and also click on him :)</p>
            <div id="main-example-container" style="width:1300px;">
                <img id="main-example" src="images/ryu_stand_still.png">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="project-start">
            <h2>Getting Started with Our Project</h2>
            <p>Here's what we need to achieve this project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our 4 images. Including: Ryu at a stand still, Ryu animated, Ryu in the Hadouken pose and our famous Hadouken.</li>
                <li>An empty &lt;div&gt; which we'll be working from.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Luckily for you, I've included a nice little &lt;div&gt; below with an ID of 'my-div' (pardon the lack of originality). You already know how to select this div, don't know? Below's the code just in case you want to double check.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div')</code></pre>

            <div id="my-div"></div>
            <p>Here's what you should see in your console:</p>
            <img src="images/code-along-1.png" class="screenshot">

            <h3>Adding Ryu at stand still</h3>
            <p>Now that we have our &lt;div&gt; selected, let's add Ryu at stand still. The image you need is available here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png</a></p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png"&gt;')</code></pre>
            <img src="images/code-along-2.png" class="screenshot">
            
            <p class="protip">Protip: If you type the wrong command and don't know how to go back to where we were, you can simple refresh this page and start over. Remember the "up" arrow shortcut in the console :)</p>

            <p>Quick side note: You'll notice that our last line of code has a little "&#9654;". This means that there's more details to be found in there. If you click on that line you should see the &lt;div&gt; expand and reveal our newly added image, like so:</p>
            <img src="images/code-along-3.png" class="screenshot">

            <h3>Adding our animated Ryu</h3>
            <p>When a user hover's over our image, we want to animate Ryu as if he was ready to fight. Here is the gif we'll need: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif</a>. To achieve this we'll use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/hover/" target="blank">jQuery's Hover API</a>, which can take 1 or 2 functions. Functions you say? What is THAT? Well... a function is basically a block of code you want to execute.</p>

            <p>Just a second ago I mentioned that <a href="http://api.jquery.com/hover/" target="blank">jQuery's Hover API</a> can take 1 or 2 functions here's the difference: If you use 1 function, this function will run when a user hovers over the element. That's it. If you use 2 functions, the 1st function will run when the user hovers over the element and the 2nd function will run when the user "un-hovers" (or stops hovering) over the element.</p>

            <p>For this example we'll need to use 2 functions. The first function will change Ryu from a stand still position to an animated one. The second function (which will run when the user stops hovering over our image) will change Ryu from an animated position back to a stand still one.</p>

            <p>Below is the code you need to run.</p>
            <p>Quick note: Since you're using your console, it's easier to type all of this code in one long line. But, if you prefer to use several lines, you can also hit "option" + "enter" on a Mac to get a new line. Just like before, to run your code simply hit "enter".</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div img').hover( function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif'
}, function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png'
})</code></pre>
            <p>Let's go over what's happening in the above block of code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"$('#my-div img')" - First, we select the image that is inside #my-div.</li>
                <li>".hover(" - Then use jQuery's hover API.</li>
                <li>"function() { this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif' }" - We then pass our first function. All this is saying is that we'll change the source (or, as said in HTMl, the "src") for this" element. The "this" here refers to the image inside our div, which we selected 2 steps ago. Here's a detailed explanation on using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3127429/javascript-this-keyword" target="blank">"this"</a> in JavaScript and jQuery (a tricky concept).</li>
                <li>"," - Is used to separate our functions.</li>
                <li>"function() { this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png' }" - Lastly we pass our second function, which does the same as our previous function, but with a different image.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Checkpoint: Here's all the code we've entered so far. Feel free to copy/ paste this in your terminal if you get stuck or refresh the page.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png"&gt;')
$('#my-div img').hover( function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif'
}, function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png'
})
</code></pre>

            <p>It's totally ok to feel slightly confused right now. If you keep reading this guide you'll get the hang of it. We still have a bit more to do, giving us plenty of time to practice. Here's what coming next:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Hadouken pose when a user clicks on Ryu</li>
                <li>Add the Hadouken next to Ryu</li>
                <li>Make the Hadouken move</li>
                <li>Get Ryu out of the Hadouken pose</li>
                <li>Remove the Hadouken once it's done moving</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Hadouken Pose</h3>

            <h3>Adding The Hadouken</h3>

            <h3>Animating The Hadouken</h3>

            <h3>Getting Ryu out of the Hadouken Pose</h3>
            <p>
        </div>
        

<!-- 
        $('#my-div img').mousedown(function() {this.src = 'images/ryu_hadoken_pose_fixed.png'});
        $('#my-div img').mousedown(function() {$('#my-div').append('<img class="demo-hadouken moving-hadouken" src="images/hadouken.gif" class="moving-hadouken">');});
