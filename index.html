        <h1>Learning jQuery with Street Fighter and Hadoukens</h1>
        
        <div class="section" id="introduction">
            <p>Through this interactive guide you'll gain a basic understanding of jQuery and how to use it on your own projects. You'll learn how to select elements, how to modify them and we'll even get to use some really cool jQuery animations.</p>

            <p>To get through this guide you'll need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and CSS selectors. If you'd like a refresher on these topics you can use <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/terminology-syntax-intro" target="blank">Shay's intro to CSS & HTML</a>. Also, it's worth mentioning that we're not going to focus on jQuery best practices but instead on we'll focus on getting familiar with jQuery through repetition and step-by-step examples.</p>

            <p>Disclosure: This guide uses Ryu from Street Fighter and his world famous Hadoukens. As you can imagine, both Ryu and his Hadoukens are trademarks of <a href="http://www.capcom.com/" target="blank">Capcom</a>.</p> 

            <p>Ready? Let's dive in!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="what-is-jquery">
            <h2>What is jQuery</h2>
            <p>A said on jQuery.com: "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling..."</p>

            <p>Here's another way to put it: jQuery is a very powerful JavaScript library that helps you do awesome things within the browser without having to worry about cross-browser differences. This means that the jQuery code you write will work seamlessly in Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Time to Get Our Hands Dirty</h2>
        <div class="section" id="opening-the-console">
            <p>In this guide we'll be using <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="blank">Google Chrome's</a> <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/console" target="blank">console</a>. Yes, you can use any browser you'd like but I strongly recommend you switch to Chrome to follow along. If you don't have Chrome, you can <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="blank">download it here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Opening Chrome's Console</h3>
            <p>Google Chrome gives you access to this thing called the "console". The console allows you to write JavaScript (and, in our case, jQuery) and see the results right away. Here's how to open the console:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the keyboard shortcut Command: Option + J (Mac) or Control + Shift  + J (Windows/Linux).</li>
                <li>You can also go to View > Developer > JavaScript Console.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's what your console should look like.</p>
            <image src="images/chrome-console-1.png" class="screenshot" />
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="selecting-an-element">
            <h3>Selecting an Element with jQuery</h3>
            <p>To select the green box below, simply type this in your console then press "enter": (yes yes, you need to follow along)</p>
            <pre id="stop-green-top"><code>$('#green-box')</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div id="green-box-container">
            <div id="green-box"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="section pulled">            
            <p>Here's what just happened:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="code-review">$</span> The dollar sign is how we use jQuery, which has already been loaded in this guide for you.</li>
                <li><span class="code-review">('#green-box')</span> This is how we select an element with an ID of 'green-box'.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You should see something like this, meaning that the element we're selecting is a &lt;div> with an ID of 'green-box'.</p>
            <image src="images/green-box-1.png" class="screenshot" />
        </div>

        <div class="section pulled" id="jquery-api">
            <h3>Using the jQuery API</h3>
            <p>Now that you know how to select an element, let's go ahead and change the color of our square. How about a nice <a href="http://www.cssportal.com/css3-color-names/" target="blank">LightSkyBlue</a> color? (That's the name of the CSS color.) In order to do this we will use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/css/" target="blank">jQuery's CSS API</a>. Here's what we'll need to type:</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('background-color','lightskyblue')</code></pre>

            <p>Can you guess what just happened?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="code-review">$('#green-box')</span> We selected an element with an ID of 'green-box'.</li>
                <li><span class="code-review">.css(</span> We used jQuery's CSS API.</li>
                <li><span class="code-review">'background-color','lightskyblue' </span> We changed the background-color CSS property of this element to a lightskyblue color.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="protip">Protip: You can use the "up" arrow in your console to get the last command you typed. This will save you tons of time.</p>
            <p class="protip">Protip dos: Even though you can copy/ paste the sample code provided, I strongly suggest you actually type things out. This will help you learn wayyy more. I Promise.</p>

            <p>Let's now change the border color to a nice <a href="http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/images/1/15/Zoolander.jpg" target="blank">steelblue</a> color. Can you guess how to do this?</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('border-color','steelblue')</code></pre>

            <p>We basically used the same command as above, but instead of changing the background-color we changed the border-color.</p>

            <p>Actually, how about we remove the background color altogether by setting it to 'transparent'?</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').css('background-color','transparent')</code></pre>

            <p>Are you getting the hang of it? See, not as hard as you thought :)</p>

            <p>Ready for something amazing? Let's add a hadouken inside our transparent box.</p>

            <p>We have a hadouken image conveniently saved at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif</a>. To add this image to our box we'll use an <a href="http://htmldog.com/reference/htmltags/img/" target="blank">HTML image tag</a> to create the image and use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/html/" target="blank">jQuery's HTML API</a> to add the image.</p>

            <p>Here's how to do this:</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').html('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" />')</code></pre>

            <p>Another way to add the hadouken would be to use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/append/" target="blank">jQuery's Append API</a>.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#green-box').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/8NArGWZ.gif" />')</code></pre>

            <p><b>Extra credit:</b> Can you guess what happens if you run the 'append' command several times? Now try running the 'html' one several times. I'll let you play with this for a minute...</p>
            
            <p class="protip">Protip: Remember that you can use the "up" arrow in your console to go back to a previous command.</p>

            <p>...</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>...</p>

            <p>Were you able to spot the difference? If you're about to say that the 'append' command keeps on appending hadoukens forever while the 'html' command replaces everything with only 1 hadouken you'd be 100% right!</p>

            <div class="summary">

            <h2 id="stop-green-bottom">Your First jQuery Project</h2>
            <p>You now have a basic understanding of jQuery. How about we deepen your jQuery chops by working on a small project together? Here's what I propose: Let's make <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ryu+hadouken&tbm=isch" target="blank">Ryu fire a hadouken</a>.</p> 

            <p>This is what our end project will look like. (Make sure you hover on Ryu and also click on him :)</p>
            
            <div id="main-example-container" style="width:960px;">
                <img id="main-example" src="images/ryu_stand_still.png">
            </div>
            <div id="main-example-add-sound">Add Hadouken sound</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="project-start">
            <h2>Getting Started with Our Project</h2>
            <p>Here's what we need to achieve this project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Our 4 images. Including: Ryu at a stand still, Ryu animated, Ryu in the Hadouken pose and our famous Hadouken.</li>
                <li>An empty &lt;div&gt; which we'll be working from.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Luckily for you, I've included a nice little &lt;div&gt; below with an ID of 'my-div' (pardon the lack of originality). You already know how to select this div, don't know? Below's the code just in case you want to double check.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div')</code></pre>

            <div id="my-div"></div>
            <p>Here's what you should see in your console:</p>
            <img src="images/code-along-1.png" class="screenshot">

            <h3>Adding Ryu at a stand still</h3>
            <p>Now that we have our &lt;div&gt; selected, let's add Ryu at stand still. The image you need is available here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png</a></p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png"&gt;')</code></pre>
            <img src="images/code-along-2.png" class="screenshot">
            
            <p class="protip">Protip: If you type the wrong command and don't know how to go back to where we were, you can simple refresh this page and start over. Remember the "up" arrow shortcut in the console :)</p>

            <p>Quick side note: You'll notice that our last line of code has a little "&#9654;". This means that there's more details to be found in there. If you click on that line you should see the &lt;div&gt; expand and reveal our newly added image, like so:</p>
            <img src="images/code-along-3.png" class="screenshot">

            <h3>Adding our animated Ryu</h3>
            <p>When a user hover's over our image, we want to animate Ryu as if he was ready to fight. Here is the gif we'll need: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif" target="blank">http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif</a>. To achieve this we'll use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/hover/" target="blank">jQuery's Hover API</a>, which can take 1 or 2 functions. Functions you say? What is THAT? Well... a function is basically a block of code you want to execute.</p>

            <p>Just a second ago I mentioned that <a href="http://api.jquery.com/hover/" target="blank">jQuery's Hover API</a> can take 1 or 2 functions here's the difference: If you use 1 function, this function will run when a user hovers over the element. That's it. If you use 2 functions, the 1st function will run when the user hovers over the element and the 2nd function will run when the user "un-hovers" (or stops hovering) over the element.</p>

            <p>For this example we'll need to use 2 functions. The first function will change Ryu from a stand still position to an animated one. The second function (which will run when the user stops hovering over our image) will change Ryu from an animated position back to a stand still one.</p>

            <p>Below is the code you need to run.</p>
            <p>Quick note: Since you're using your console, it's easier to type all of this code in one long line. But, if you prefer to use several lines, you can also hit "option" + "enter" on a Mac to get a new line. Just like before, to run your code simply hit "enter".</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div img').hover( function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif'
}, function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png'
})</code></pre>
            <p>Let's go over what's happening in the above block of code.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"$('#my-div img')" - First, we select the image that is inside #my-div.</li>
                <li>".hover(" - Then use jQuery's hover API.</li>
                <li>"function() { this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif' }" - We then pass our first function. All this is saying is that we'll change the source (or, as said in HTMl, the "src") for this" element. The "this" here refers to the image inside our div, which we selected 2 steps ago. Here's a detailed explanation on using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3127429/javascript-this-keyword" target="blank">"this"</a> in JavaScript and jQuery (a tricky concept).</li>
                <li>"," - Is used to separate our functions.</li>
                <li>"function() { this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png' }" - Lastly we pass our second function, which does the same as our previous function, but with a different image.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Checkpoint: Here's all the code we've entered so far. Feel free to copy/ paste this in your terminal if you get stuck or refresh the page.</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div').append('&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png"&gt;')
$('#my-div img').hover( function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/TYvGQPJ.gif'
}, function() {
    this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/JFMYx3j.png'
})
</code></pre>

            <p>It's totally ok to feel slightly confused right now. If you keep reading this guide you'll get the hang of it. We still have a bit more to do, giving us plenty of time to practice. Here's what coming next:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Hadouken pose when a user clicks on Ryu</li>
                <li>Add the Hadouken next to Ryu</li>
                <li>Make the Hadouken move</li>
                <li>Get Ryu out of the Hadouken pose</li>
                <li>Remove the Hadouken once it's done moving</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Hadouken Pose</h3>
            <p>We now want to change Ryu's pose when someone clicks on him. To do this we'll use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/mousedown/" target="blank">jQuery's Mousedown API</a>. Mousedown only takes 1 function and it will allow us to trigger this function whenever the user presses down on their mouse. Here's how to use it:</p>
            <pre><code>$('#my-div img').mousedown( function() {this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/1F4rSOc.png' });</code></pre>
            
            <p>And here's what's happening:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"$('#my-div img')" - First, we select the image that is inside #my-div.</li>
                <li>".mousedown(" - Then use jQuery's Mousedown API.</li>
                <li>"function() { this.src = 'http://i.imgur.com/1F4rSOc.png' }" - We then pass our function which will change the src of the image. This is VERY similar to what we did earlier.
            </ul>

         <div class="section" id="installing-jquery">
             <h3>How to install jQuery?</h3>
             <p>The easiest way to install jQuery is to grab the code from <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery" target="blank">Google</a>. Here is the code snippet:</p>
             <pre><code>&lt;script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

             <p>Note: Notice that there's no "http:" or "https:" before the "//" in the src of the tag. This ensures that both HTTP and HTTPS pages can load this code. If you're coding locally on your computer you'll need to add "http:" to the beginning of the src to make sure jQuery loads. Here's what your script should look like:</p>
             <pre><code>&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

             <p>You can now create a basic html file and add the jQuery script inside the &lt;head&gt; tag. In the example below we also added a JavaScript file called 'example.js', this is where we would hypothetically write our jQuery code.</p>
             <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
         &lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
         &lt;script src="example.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;!-- Your content goes here -->
     &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
             <p>Note: You'll want to make sure to only use jQuery once your DOM is ready. Don't worry if this sounds abstract and confusing, <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/" target="blank">here's an explanation and how to achieve this</a>.</p>
